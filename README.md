## Installation

This plugin is not yet part of the community plugin list so it cannot be installed from Obsidian so it must be installed manually with the following steps:

1. Go to repo's [Releases](https://github.com/jffaust/obsidian-variables/releases) page
2. Download `main.js`, `styles.css` and `manifest.json` from the latest release
3. Move the downloaded files to a new folder inside your plugins folder: `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-variables/`
